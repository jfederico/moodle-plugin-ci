title: Introduction
---

The goal of this project is to facilitate the running of tests and code analysis against a Moodle plugin in
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org).  All of these tests and tools are run everytime a change is pushed to a GitHub
branch or pull request.

Why would you want to do this?  It saves you from having to remember to setup and run PHPUnit, Behat, code checker, etc
every single time you make a change.  If you have enough test coverage, it also makes accepting pull requests painless
because you can be more confident that the change wont break anything.  There are many more advantages to using a
service like Travis CI, like being able to test your code against multiple databases, multiple PHP versions, etc.

This project supports the following testing frameworks and code analysis tools:
* [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de)
* [Behat](http://behat.org/)
* [Moodle Code Checker](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_codechecker)
* [Mustache Linting](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Templates)
* [Grunt tasks](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Grunt)
* [PHP Linting](https://github.com/JakubOnderka/PHP-Parallel-Lint)
* [PHP Copy/Paste Detector](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpcpd)
* [PHP Mess Detector](http://phpmd.org)

## Requirements

The requirements for **Version 2** are **PHP 5.6** or later and **Moodle 3.2** or later.

In addition, the plugin being tested must have a [version.php](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/version.php) file
and `$plugin->component` must be defined within it.

If you need to run your plugin in earlier versions of Moodle, then please use Version 1 of this tool.  Documentation
and more information about Version 1 can be found in the [v1](https://github.com/moodlerooms/moodle-plugin-ci/tree/v1)
branch.  Please know that Version 1 is no longer getting new features and may not receive additional updates.

## Getting started

Follow these steps to get your Moodle plugin building in Travis CI.

### Step 1

Sign into [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) with your GitHub account. Once youâ€™re signed in, and Travis CI will have
synchronized your repositories from GitHub.  Go to your [profile](https://travis-ci.org/profile) page and enable Travis CI
for the plugin you want to build.  Now whenever your plugin receives an update or gets a new pull request, Travis CI will
run a build to make sure nothing broke.

### Step 2

Copy the [.travis.dist.yml](https://github.com/moodlerooms/moodle-plugin-ci/blob/master/.travis.dist.yml) file into the
root of your plugin and rename it to `.travis.yml`. Now might be a good time to review the `.travis.yml` contents and
remove anything that is not needed.  See this [help document](TravisFileExplained.md) for an explanation about the
contents of the this file. Once you have added the `.travis.yml` file, commit and push up to GitHub, to trigger a
Travis CI build. Navigate back to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) to see if your build passes or fails.

### Step 3

Congratulations, you are building on Travis CI!  Next steps on your continuous build journey include:

* Reviewing the [help documentation](Help.md) to further improve and customize your build.
* Resolve any build errors you may currently have.  Get to that ever rewarding Green Build status.
* Show off your build status by [adding the badge to your plugin's README file](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/status-images/).
* Write new tests to increase your code coverage.
* Enjoy your favorite beverage because you no longer have to waste time manually testing your plugin!

## Upgrading

Guides to updating your plugin's `.travis.yml` file to use the latest versions of this tool.

* [Upgrade to 2.0](UPGRADE-2.0.md)
