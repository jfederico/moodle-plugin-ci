The goal of this project is to facilitate the running of tests and code analysis against a Moodle plugin in
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org).  All of these tests and tools are run everytime a change is pushed to a GitHub
branch or pull request.

All documentation, guides, change log, etc can be found here: https://moodlerooms.github.io/moodle-plugin-ci/
